// How does Angular work?
// - Q1: How does Angular work from files perspective? In what file it starts loading, what files are loaded next?

/**
 * - angular.json: Here is the schema where we specify how our project
 *                 must load itself.
 *                 It specifies the initial file that will be loaded. EG: "main": "src/main.ts"
 * 
 * - package-lock.json
 * - package.json
 * - README.md
 * - task.md
 * - tsconfig.app.json
 * - tsconfig.json
 * - tsconfig.spec.json
 *
