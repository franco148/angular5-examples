// What are pros and cons of Angular compared to React?
// - Q1: What are Angular pros and cons?

/**
 * PROS:
 * Angular out of the bos delivers fast quite a lot of stuff like for example
 * routing, animations, words, services and much more, which actually means we 
 * are getting quite a lot of stuff out of the box without the need of installing
 * additional libraries.
 * 
 * Secondly, sinde Angular, we are getting TypeScript by default, it means we are
 * getting static typing and this is extremely important to build safer applications
 * 
 * Use of RxJs for implementing applications in a reactive way.
 * 
 * Native dependency injection implementation.
 * 
 * 
 * CONS:
 * First of all, the level of entrance is really high because we need to learn.
 * 
 * We have thing like TypeScript, RxJs and it is really difficult to start using 
 * Angular on a good level if you don't master them
 * 
 * We have breaking changes from major version, to major version.
 * 
 * The code base of angular is extremely huge.
 *

// - Q2: How it is compared to React?

/**
 * A lot of people assume if you can do Angular, you have some experience with React.
 * Actually it is not that much to say here because these two frameworks are completely 
 * sufficient to build large applications.
 * 
 * Also the level of entrance inside React is much smaller. 
 * 
 * Additionaly to that, react doesn't have inside things like working with HTTP, 
 * implementing services, routing or dependency injections.
