// - Q1: What is HTML in Angular?

/**
 *  It looks like each HTML and the file extension is HTML, but actually it is not. You can see it is not valid HTML. 
 * We have here things like square brackets, round brackets, then square and round brackets. This is not a valid HTML. 
 * This is a special angular syntax which is just angular template, which actually means angular template and HTML 
 * are made similar to look like HTML, but actually it is much more so. 
 * 
 * Angular passes every single template file and transforms it to the function, which actually means this or even HTML 
 * parts which are readable are not being used by angular as HTML.
 * 
 * Everything here is transformed in the functions  and then this functions are executed to build a dom.
